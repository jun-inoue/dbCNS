 Database of conserved non-coding sequence

<table width="200" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>dbCNS is a database of Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNSs).<br>
        The database consists of published CNEs and genome sequences.<br>
        Users can <br>
            - collect published CNSs using a key word such as target gene name.<br>
            - generate a candidate CNS sequence using a user-defined-SNP cortinate.<br>
            - make multiple alignments of CNSs by uploading query sequences.<br>
